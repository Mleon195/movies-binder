# Using branches

As you start each lab in the series you are strongly encouraged to:

* start from the previous solutions and build on them
* do your work on your own new local branch

**ACHTUNG! do not FORK this repo; just CLONE it.**


## First sprint and setup

**Follow these steps only on your first sprint!**

* For sprint 1, after you clone the repo, make sure you're on a personal local branch.  

```sh
git checkout -b my_work_sprint_1
```
   > `git checkout -b` creates a new, local branch from the current branch.



## Subsequent Sprints

**Follow these steps on every sprint except the first one!**
> Why? You likely have changes from previous sprints that need to be committed first!

Here's how you can do that:

Let's assume you're starting *sprint 2*

1. Save your changes to any files you've been working on. 

1. Commit any changes you've made.
   
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "saving my changes on sprint X"
   ```
   Then verify that the above worked.  If `git status` shows that your *working directory is clean* you're good to go!

   
1. Check out the next solution branch using `git checkout REMOTE/BRANCH_NAME`.  Note that our remote is `origin` if you cloned the repo.

   ```sh
   git checkout solutions_sprint_1
   ```
   > If you're starting sprint 2, use the solutions from 1 as your starting point.
   > Using `origin/BRANCH_NAME` says to use origin's copy of that branch, ignoring any local changes you may have made.

   
1. Create a new branch for your work in this sprint.
   
   ```sh
   git checkout -b my_work_sprint_2
   ```
   > `git checkout -b` creates a new, local branch from the current branch.
   
1. Begin working!  Make all your commits on **YOUR** branch.



## Getting updated solutions

If at some point we tell you that you **need** updated solutions follow these instructions.

1. **Before you checkout** the solution branch; fetch the data from `origin`

   ```sh
   git fetch origin
   ```

1. Follow the instructions in [subsequent sprints](#Subsequent Sprints)

> When you checkout **make sure** that you specify that you want the copy from the remote by prepending `origin/` to the branch name.  e.g.:
>
>   ```sh
>   git checkout origin/solutions_sprint_3
>   ```
> 
> The instructions above already use `origin/`, so if you follow them it should just work.
